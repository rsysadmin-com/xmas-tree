# xmas-tree
Perl and Bash one-liner to show a Xmas tree on your console/terminal. 

![Alt text](xmas-tree.png?raw=true "A Xmas Tree in Perl/Bash")

## history
I found the original Perl one-liner many many years ago in some `alt.programmig.perl` group or similar - I honestly cannot remember where it was anymore -, and I tried to keep a copy of it every time I switched to a new computer.

If you are the original author reading this, please DM me :-)

I'm uploading it to GitHub so:

- I don't need to worry where is it anymore
- others can use it

## update
- 16.12.2024: I created the Bash equivalent one-liner, for those of you who do not like Perl (anymore) :-)

## tweaks

Adjust the values in the first for-loop (Perl: `for(1..20)`, Bash: `for i in {1..20}`) if you want it to run a longer/less time.
