# xmas-tree
Perl one-liner to show a Xmas tree on your console/terminal. 

![Alt text](xmas-tree.png?raw=true "A Xmas Tree in Perl")

## history
I found this one-liner many many years ago in some `alt.programmig.perl` forum or similar - I honestly cannot remember where anymore -, and I tried to keep a copy of it every time I switched to a new computer.

If you are the original author reading this, please DM me :-)

I'm uploading it to GitHub so:

- I don't need to worry where is it anymore
- others can use it


## tweaks

Adjust the values in the first for-loop (now `for(1..20)`) if you want it to run longer/less.
